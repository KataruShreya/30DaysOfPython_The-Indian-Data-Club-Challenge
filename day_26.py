# CODE LOGIC

'''

1. We import necessary modules:
   - FastAPI and HTTPException from fastapi to build and handle the API and errors.
   - BaseModel and Field from pydantic to define request and response schemas with validation.
   - List and Optional from typing to specify types for lists and optional fields.

2. We initialize the FastAPI app using:
   - api = FastAPI() to create an instance of the application.

3. We define data models using Pydantic:
   - BookBase: Base schema with fields title, year, and author.
     â†’ Uses Field() for validation like max length and descriptions.
   - BookCreate: Inherits from BookBase, used specifically for creating new books.
   - Book: Extends BookBase by adding a book_id, used in responses.
   - BookUpdate: Allows optional updates to title, year, or author.

4. We create a mock database:
   - all_books is a list of Book objects representing a pre-filled in-memory database.

5. We define the endpoint /books/{book_id} (GET):
   - Retrieves a single book by its ID.
   - Iterates over all_books and returns the matching book.
   - If not found, raises a 404 error.

6. We define the endpoint /books/ (GET):
   - Returns the full list of books from all_books.

7. We define the endpoint /books (POST):
   - Accepts a new book via BookCreate.
   - Automatically assigns the next available book_id.
   - Appends the new book to all_books.
   - Returns the created book.

8. We define the endpoint /books/{book_id} (PUT):
   - Accepts updates using the BookUpdate model.
   - Searches for the book by ID and updates any fields provided.
   - Returns the updated book or raises 404 if not found.

9. We define the endpoint /books/{book_id} (DELETE):
   - Finds and removes a book by ID from all_books.
   - Returns the deleted book or raises a 404 error if not found.

10. Result:
   - A fully functional RESTful API for managing a library.
   - Supports all CRUD operations: Create, Read, Update, Delete.
   - Includes input validation, optional updates, and automatic documentation using FastAPI.
